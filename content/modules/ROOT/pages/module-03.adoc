If you are running a C program, use GCC to compile and link the source
code with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
gcc helloworld.c -o helloworld
----

If your program is in C++, use this command to compile and link the
source code:

[source,bash]
----
g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld
----

Then, modify the permissions on the helloworld executable to allow it to
be run with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x helloworld
----

Now, run your program with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
./helloworld
----
